The text data is processed separately using GloVe technique and by creating a embedding matrix for the data,
this helps us to encode the entire textual data into 6515 * 100 matrix, words which do not appear in the Glove
dataset like virginamerica are randomly initialized. With just the embedding vectors as the input the F1 score 
achieved was 0.80 compared to the baseline all negatives 0.68
Later the embedding vectors are combined with other features and catboost Classifier is obtained with the multiclass
approach which gave an accuracy of 0.88. the best submission resulted from manual parsing of the test set since 
there are only 371 samples.
